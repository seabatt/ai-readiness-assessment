## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The application uses the official Ai.Work brand system with a custom dark theme. Key elements include a specific color palette (primary background #141414, highlight #82D895, text colors #FBFAF9, #8A8784), standardized spacing, 200ms transitions, and a simplified loading screen design. The landing page features a direct "Get Your Assessment" CTA button (no email input on homepage), followed by "5 minutes • Instant results" timing text. Email capture occurs post-assessment via an email gate strategy for improved conversion. The email gate shows the number of identified opportunities with compelling copy: "We've identified X ways you can employ an AI Worker to deflect tickets immediately. Unlock the complete list." The landing page uses conversational, user-focused messaging with a streamlined "What You'll Discover" section (py-12 spacing, text-2xl md:text-3xl heading, 6 items in 2 columns). All CTA buttons use consistent white styling (bg-white text-black px-8 py-4) with green highlight dot on left and ">" on right. Assessment results are structured to "hit harder" for IT leaders, focusing on algorithm analysis, concrete metrics, and immediate opportunities. Typography uses NB International Pro with multiple weights, with text-lg standardized for body paragraphs. All logos display with hover tooltips (green glow effects removed from CustomReportCTA). Numbers are formatted as X.XM or X.XK for readability (e.g., $2.9M instead of $2,909K).

### Technical Implementations
-   **Framework & Styling**: Next.js 14.2 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
-   **UI Libraries**: Framer Motion (animations), Recharts (data visualization), React Hook Form + Zod (form validation), @dnd-kit (drag and drop), Lucide React (icons).
-   **Database & Persistence**: PostgreSQL database (Neon-backed) with Drizzle ORM for storing assessment reports. Schema includes assessments table with UUID primary key, email field (optional text), JSONB fields for tech stack/ticket distribution/report data, integer for monthly tickets, optional text context, and timestamps. Service layer in `src/lib/services/assessmentService.ts` provides CRUD operations. API routes at `/api/assessments` (POST to create), `/api/assessments/[id]` (GET by ID), `/api/assessments/[id]/update-email` (PATCH to add email), and `/api/assessments/submit-email` (POST fallback) handle database interactions with proper error handling. WebSocket support requires `bufferutil` package for Neon serverless driver.
-   **HubSpot Integration**: Site-wide tracking script loaded in root layout (Portal ID: 145411173, region: eu1). HubSpot form (ID: 336ea270-b317-44e7-b3a8-132aae822d08) integrated into CustomReportCTA component within the "7-Day Ticket Listening Process" section. Custom dark theme styling applied to forms via src/styles/hubspot-form.css.
-   **Assessment Flow**: A 3-step process including Tech Stack Selection, Volume & Service Profile (with categorized ticket distribution sliders), and optional Additional Context. Upon completion, assessment is saved to PostgreSQL database during loading screen (without email), then user is redirected to email gate page (`/email-gate?id={assessmentId}`). After email submission, existing assessment record is updated with email via PATCH to `/api/assessments/[id]/update-email`, and user is redirected to full report page.
-   **Analysis Engines** (`src/lib/engines/`):
    -   **FeasibilityEngine**: Analyzes user tech stack against `tool-apis.json` to identify available APIs and use cases, normalizing tool names.
    -   **UseCaseMatcher**: Matches ticket distribution to specific AI Workers, calculating fit scores, estimating deflection, and prioritizing use cases.
    -   **ROICalculator**: Calculates precise ROI from matched use cases, including FTE equivalents and category-level breakdowns with confidence scores.
-   **Assessment Results Generation**: 
    -   **V4 Reports**: Includes AI-generated strategic insights in Executive Summary, "How to Identify Valuable Use Cases" section, and CTA sections.
    -   **V5 Reports** (default): Streamlined data-focused version without LLM-generated insights. Includes:
        -   **Report Header**: Displays "AI Worker Readiness Assessment" as the main title (text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold) with a concise subheader showing "Analysis complete for X connected tools and Y monthly tickets" (text-xl text-text-secondary). Consistent styling with email gate page.
        -   **Executive Summary**: Clean metrics display with readiness percentage badge (color dynamically matches percentage color) and key statistics. No LLM-generated insights or CTA in this section.
        -   **Opportunity Analysis**: Begins directly with "What You Can Automate Right Now" heading and single-column full-width use case cards (grid grid-cols-1 gap-6). Cards feature tool logos prominently displayed in top right (48px with circular backgrounds and borders via "prominent" prop). Title (text-2xl), category badge, and rank number positioned on left. Enhanced metrics section uses text-3xl numbers with subtle bg-bg-primary/50 background and improved spacing. Description uses text-lg. Collapsible "How it works" section at bottom. No fit scores, deployment timing badges, or CTA sections displayed.
    -   **Deployment Plan**: Provides a comprehensive "Get Started Plan" with standard HTML tables including 3-column timeline with phases formatted as two lines (e.g., "Phase One" / bold "Integration Setup"), required assets section renamed to "What You Will Need to Collect" with 4 detailed categories (Rules, Data, Connections, Stakeholder Alignment), and internal alignment for 7 stakeholder roles. All messaging is vendor-agnostic. Text sizing uses text-lg for consistency.
    -   **Expected Outcomes**: Details pilot metrics, before/after scenarios, and team capacity gains.
    -   **Call to Action**: CustomReportCTA with white button "Run the Full Discovery Assessment >" with green dot, linking to book-a-demo, preceded by description text. This CTA promotes the deeper Data Discovery and Blueprint engagement that follows this initial assessment. Button matches app-wide styling (bg-white text-black px-8 py-4 rounded-lg, centered text with green highlight dot on left and ">" on right).
-   **LLM Integration**: V4 reports use OpenAI GPT-4o for generating strategic "Key Insights" in the Executive Summary, analyzing ROI metrics, tech stack, and user context. V5 reports (default) do not use LLM-generated content.
-   **Data Handling**: Fixed critical ROI calculation bug by implementing capacity tracking to prevent ticket double-counting. Standardized number formatting and filtered irrelevant categories.

### Feature Specifications
-   **ConnectedAppLogos component**: Displays logos with hover tooltips. Supports "prominent" mode with circular backgrounds, borders, and hover scale effects for emphasizing key integrations.
-   **V5 Assessment Results**: The primary/default assessment results experience (as of October 2025), offering API-grounded analysis and specific recommendations with a reorganized section order for clearer user flow. Available at `/report/v5/[id]` route where `[id]` can be "new" (loads from sessionStorage) or a database UUID (loads from database). Share button copies current URL to clipboard for easy sharing of persisted assessments.
-   **V4 Assessment Results**: Previous version, still available at `/report/v4/new` route. Currently identical to V5.
-   **Email Gate Strategy**: After users complete the 3-step assessment, they are shown an email gate page with the message "We've identified X ways you can employ an AI Worker to deflect tickets immediately" and a button to "Unlock Full Assessment". The assessment is already saved to the database (with full analysis generated) but without email, making it durable across page refreshes. Users must enter their work email to unlock access, which updates the existing database record. This post-assessment email capture improves conversion by ensuring users are invested before requesting contact information.
-   **Assessment Data**: Captures monthly tickets, ticket distribution, email, and additional context. Each completed assessment is persisted to PostgreSQL with a unique UUID for future retrieval and sharing with sales reps.
-   **Workflow Steps Styling**: Collapsible "How it Works" section with updated number styling and toggle arrow positioned left of text.
-   **Terminology**: This tool is called an "Assessment" (both the process and output). The deeper engagement that follows is the "Data Discovery and Blueprint" service.
