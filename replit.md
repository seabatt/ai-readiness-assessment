### October 15, 2025 - V3 Report: Compelling Narrative Structure
- Created V3 report with new narrative flow that "hits harder" for IT leaders under pressure:
  - **Executive Summary**: "Here's what we found" - opens directly with algorithm analysis, concrete metrics, and immediate opportunity payoff
  - **Opportunity Analysis**: Top 5 automations with concrete examples, deflection %, tech stack integration, enterprise capabilities
  - **Best Fit Use Cases**: 3-5 real scenarios showing Workstream → Skills → Agents breakdown with measurable outcomes
  - **Get-Started Roadmap**: Crawl (Week 1-2) → Walk (Week 3-4) → Run (Month 2-3) with specific use cases per phase
  - **Expected Outcomes**: Pilot metrics timeline, before/after comparison, team capacity gains grounded in operational reality
  - **Custom Report CTA**: "~70% accurate → 100% with your ticket data" messaging with 7-day listening process
- Implemented **Ai.Work tone of voice** throughout:
  - Confident, not overblown (no hype language)
  - Operationally fluent (enterprise language: guardrails, RBAC, audit logs)
  - Empowering, not replacing ("AI Workers free your team" not "AI replaces staff")
  - Clear, grounded, direct, credible
- **V2 Archived**: Moved V2 to `/report/archive/v2/[id]` with redirect for reference
- **Assessment Flow**: Updated to redirect to `/report/v3/new` after completion
- **V3 is now the primary report experience**

- Fixed landing page "Start Assessment" button to properly navigate to /assessment route
- Corrected assessment page to use modular components instead of inline implementation:
  - TechStackSelector for step 1 (tech stack selection with categorized tools)
  - WorkflowRanker for step 2 (top 5 workflow selection)
  - ScaleQuestions for step 3 (ticket volume, team size, etc.)
  - CurrentStateQuestions for step 4 (approval workflows, pain points)
  - LoadingScreen for step 5 (loading animation before report)
- Resolved Next.js build cache corruption issues by clearing .next folder
