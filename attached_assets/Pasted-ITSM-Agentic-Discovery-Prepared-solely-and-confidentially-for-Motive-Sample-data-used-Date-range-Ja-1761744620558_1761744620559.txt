ITSM Agentic
Discovery Prepared solely and confidentially for Motive
Sample data used
Date range: January 21 - September 10, 2025
Ticket volume: 19,501 tickets
Data Preprocessing Assumptions
Categorization
ai.work’s discovery agent added a layer of categorization as tickets in Jira were already categorized, but not
in a sufficient way to reach accurate conclusions on whether they can be automated with agentic AI and to
what extent.
This includes:
●
Tickets with a generic category (“Get IT help”)
●
Tickets with wrong category used
●
Too broad categories
The discovery agent re-classified the tickets into a 3-level hierarchy:
1. Category - For example: Applications, Hardware
2. Sub-category - For example: Applications->App access, Applications->App issue
3. Entity - For example: Github, Asana
* The discovery agent relied solely on its categorization labels
Resolution time
Time to resolution was calculated by subtracting the “Status Category Changed” and “created at” fields
(Only calculated for tickets that their “Status Category” is Done).
AI Automation readiness
The tickets data does not include information about how tickets were resolved. We used our experience to
estimate the potential AI automation opportunities.
Human agent time
There is no tangible data on how much work time each ticket actually took once initiated until conclusion
by the human agent. Resolution time was used as a proxy in absence.
Data on ticket resolution per employee exists and ai.work’s discovery agent used it to estimate potential
impact on ROI (headcount). A conservative approach was taken which assumed that potential automated
tickets are the easier tickets that are being handled by the employees that resolve most tickets over time.

Example Tickets:
●
VPN Access: “I need to get VPN access to connect to certain AWS resources from outside the
office?”
○
Resolution: User assigned to VPN, credentials and setup instructions provided.
●
Security Monitoring Software: “A software named ‘logger’ is recording my screen. Even if I terminate
it, it restarts. Is this spyware or IT-configured?”
○
Resolution: Confirmed logger is part of InfoSec policy; behavior due to OS update. Passwords
and sensitive data remain protected.
●
Internet Connectivity (Hotspot Device): “The signals icon is flashing, internet not working despite ISP
confirming service is fine. Device refresh didn’t help.
”
○
Resolution: Tested SIM, reassigned new SIM, and replaced hotspot device with new IMEI/IMSI
details provided.
ai.work conclusions
Phase 1: Immediate impact → expected 21.5% ticket deflection - 4 weeks
1. App access through Okta → 16.8% of tickets (3,277 tickets)*
2. Distribution List Changes → 2. 7% of tickets (527 tickets)
3. In-app actions → 2.0% of tickets (391 tickets)
a. Jira - 1.1% of tickets (213 tickets)
b. Slack - 0.9% of tickets (178 tickets)**
Assumptions
* We assume that 75% of app access tickets can be resolved through Okta, so we calculated: 0.75 * 4,369
app access tickets = 3,277.
** Slack admin API requires Enterprise Grid license
Impact
●
App access - Current median time to resolution = 1:30 hour → “real time” (+Team approval time if
enabled)
●
In-app actions - Current median time to resolution = 1:58 hour → “real time” (+Team approval time
if enabled)
●
~ 3 FTEs saved
Phase 2: Long term potential - 3-6 months
1. Goal of 30% fully automated ticket requests (assuming ai.work has necessary API connections)*
2. Additional 40% partially assisted by ai.work (does 20-80% of the work and shortens human handle
time)**
3. 30% of tickets will remain full human agent handling (specific app actions without API,
hardware/network troubleshooting, hardware logistics)
Assumptions
*Full automation assumptions
●
80% of App access = 17.9%
●

●
50% of Onboarding / Offboarding = 4.5%
●

●
30% of App issue = 7.7%
●
30% New Hardware Requests = 7.4%
●
20% of Hardware Replacement = 7%
●
30% of Network, Security and Other = 1%
●

Open Questions
1. Is the access to all apps managed through Okta ? If not, what are the other access management
methods?
2. Are there apps that require direct in-app actions to grant initial access to? Which?
3. What does the full IT onboarding process look like?
4. What does the full IT offboarding process look like?
5. Where is the asset inventory managed?
6. What is the policy for new hardware requests?
7. Are there knowledge base articles in place to answer repetitive questions and provide initial
support?
8. What are the approval flows? How are they managed?
