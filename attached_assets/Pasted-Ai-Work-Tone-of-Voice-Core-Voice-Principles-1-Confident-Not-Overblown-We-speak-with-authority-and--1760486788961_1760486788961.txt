Ai.Work Tone of Voice
Core Voice Principles
1. Confident, Not Overblown
We speak with authority and precision.
Avoid hype or exaggerated claims - our credibility comes from clarity and operational depth.
Example:
Yes: "AI Workers cut time spent on service tasks by up to 65%."
No: "Our revolutionary AI is changing everything you know about work."
2. Operationally Fluent
Use the language of enterprise departments—HR, IT, Procurement, Legal—without jargon overload.
Frame AI as part of workflows, systems, and measurable outcomes.
Example:
Yes: "The IT Worker automates access requests from ticket intake to approval, fully within enterprise guardrails."
No: "AI magically handles your IT needs."
3. Empowering, Not Replacing
Position AI Workers as enablers, not threats.
The goal is to unlock human capacity, not suggest human obsolescence.
Example:
Yes: "AI Workers free your teams from repetitive tasks so they can focus on higher-value work."
No: "AI Workers replace the need for human service teams."
