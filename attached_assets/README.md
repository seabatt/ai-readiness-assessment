# Attached Assets

This directory is for project assets like images, documents, and other files that are actively used in the application.

**Note**: Development artifacts, screenshots, and planning documents from previous work have been archived to `archive/documentation/development-artifacts/`.

Keep this folder clean and organized by:
1. Using descriptive filenames
2. Removing temporary or unused files regularly
3. Considering if files should be in the archive instead
