🎯 Primary Goal

Unify the AI Worker Readiness Assessment App with ai.work’s brand system by tightening color consistency, spacing rhythm, and tone of messaging, and standardizing the use of connected-app logos.
No changes to CTA color or button structure — this sprint focuses purely on refinement and cohesion.

🎨 Color System Implementation Tasks
1. Neutral Backgrounds

 Global background: #141414 across all pages.

 Card/container backgrounds: #1A1A1A or #41403E (one step lighter than global background).

 Avoid gradients or random color variations. Keep the dark palette minimal and controlled.

2. Highlight & Feedback States

 Replace all selection or focus indicators with #82D895.

Card hover or selected state → soft outer glow (#82D895, 20% opacity, 8px blur).

Progress bar fill and success indicators → #82D895.

“Access Granted” / “Success” → pulse highlight in #82D895.

 Remove legacy greens or teals (e.g., #CAEAC6).

 Buttons remain as is; do not alter color or structure.

3. Text & Contrast

 Use #FBFAF9 for all primary text.

 Use #8A8784 for secondary text, labels, and helper lines.

 Verify all text meets WCAG AA contrast (≥4.5:1).

 Avoid mid-gray text smaller than 14px.

🧭 Layout & Spacing Tasks
1. Global Rhythm

 Vertical spacing between major sections: 64–80px.

 Internal element spacing within a section: 24–32px.

 Card padding: 32px top/bottom, 24px sides.

 Align all content blocks to a consistent grid.

2. Hero / Intro Screen

 Retain the current structure and CTA styling.

 Add privacy statement below the CTA:

“No sensitive data stored or shared. Responses anonymized for benchmarking.”
Style: 12px, #8A8784, center aligned.

 Add 20px extra top and bottom padding for breathing room.

3. Assessment Steps

 Keep existing progress bar. Optionally add step label below it, e.g., “Step 2 of 4” (12px, #8A8784).

 Step cards: background #1A1A1A or #41403E.

 Selected card: subtle glow #82D895 (blur 8–10px, opacity 25%).

 Consistent margin between cards: 24–32px.

 Smooth transitions (200 ms fade or slide) between questions.

4. Results / Report Layout

 Divide vertically into clear sections:

Readiness Overview

Immediate Opportunities

Where AI Workers Help First

Crawl → Walk → Run Framework

What to Expect / ROI Metrics

Call to Action

 Add 80px separation between each section.

 Use a 1 px divider line (#41403E, 20% opacity) between sections.

 Maintain consistent line height (1.6) for dense paragraphs.

 Keep metrics and visuals vertically aligned for balance.

🔗 Connected-App Logo System Tasks
1. Inline Grouping

 When referencing a workflow (e.g., “Access Requests & Provisioning”), include app logos inline beneath or beside the title.

 Use official color logos, unmodified.

 Logo height: 24 px.

 Equal spacing: 12 px between icons.

 Align logos vertically with text baseline.

 Hover tooltip: “Okta Integration Active”, “Slack Connected”, etc.

2. Skill Cards (Worker Panels)

 Display app logos along the bottom edge of each skill card.

 Max 7 logos visible at once; overflow can fade out.

 Consistent size (24 px height), spacing (8–10 px).

 Hover state: slight scale-up (102%) and soft green glow (#82D895, 10% opacity).

 Tooltip reveals integration name on hover.

✍️ Messaging & Microcopy Tasks
1. Tone Alignment

 Review all text for ai.work voice: confident, clear, operational.

Replace hype language with factual, functional phrasing.

Example:

❌ “See if AI can help you work smarter!”

✅ “Assess your readiness for autonomous work.”

 Each headline or summary should answer: What insight does this give the IT leader?

2. Section Messaging

 Hero Intro Subline:

“AI Workers learn from your tickets, adapt to your processes, and improve over time.”

 Results Summary Line:

“Your team is positioned to automate access and license management workflows with minimal setup.”

 Keep copy short and data-driven. Avoid filler sentences.
