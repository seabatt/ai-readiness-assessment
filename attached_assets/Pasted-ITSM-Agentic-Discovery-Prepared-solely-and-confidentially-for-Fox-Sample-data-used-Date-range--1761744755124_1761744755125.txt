Data Preprocessing Assumptions

Categorization

ai.work’s discovery agent added a layer of categorization as tickets in ServiceNow were already categorized, but not in a sufficient way to reach accurate conclusions on whether they can be automated with agentic AI and to what extent.

This includes:
Tickets with a generic category (“Service Request”)
Tickets with wrong category used
Too broad categories

The discovery agent re-classified the tickets into a 3-level hierarchy:
Category - For example: Applications, Hardware
Sub-category - For example: Applications->App access, Applications->App issue
Entity - For example: Github, Asana

* The discovery agent relied solely on its categorization labels



AI Automation readiness

The tickets data does not include information about how tickets were resolved. We used our experience to estimate the potential AI automation opportunities.

The “Other” category includes IT tickets that do not fit neatly into the standard classifications. This includes general service desk requests, status updates, follow-ups on incidents, inquiries about corporate cards or purchasing, badge requests, password resets, access or account verifications, and miscellaneous administrative tasks. It also covers notifications about system releases, environment upgrades, patch deployments, and approvals or validations required for various internal processes. 























































Applications category
Applications are 79.47% of all tickets. Application access - Median TTR = 0.43 hours

Example tickets:


App issue
Okta - User unable to log in due to time-sync issue causing repeated verification loop, resolved by adjusting system time and re-enrolling Okta Verify.
Pagerduty - PagerDuty triggered an automated startup sequence for MCL. incident acknowledged and resolved via Moogsoft integration with no further action required.
AWS - User unable to open AWS Client due to shortcut and launch errors; technician remoted in, performed repair and update, after which the application opened and login succeeded.
Wide orbit traffic - User unable to verify login due to unresponsive mouse click. Issue resolved after remote session and user successfully accessed the application.
App access
Fox MediaCloud - Requests to get access to Fox MediaCloud.
Adobe Creative Cloud - Requests to get access to Adobe Creative Cloud.
Within app access
Outlook - User requested access to a shared or resource mailbox in Outlook. 
Within app action
Servicenow - Populate the "Assignment Group" field with the team responsible for fulfilling the request.
Slack - Requested Slack channel was renamed and archived.
Jira - "Assignment Group" field was populated with the team responsible for fulfilling the request

Resolution: password reset, network switch attempt, and OS updates.
Website Access - User requested to whitelist newly created external sites for research purposes.
Resolution - approval and exception handled by InfoSec and Network Operations.
Unauthorized Software - InfoSec identified unsupported remote-access software on users' devices. 
Resolution - technician remoted in, terminated background processes, and uninstalled the application per security policy.



















ai.work conclusions
Phase 1: Immediate impact → expected 32% ticket deflection - 4 weeks

Okta app issues → 16.81% of tickets (1588 tickets)*

App access through Okta → 13.34% of tickets (1260 tickets)**

Distribution List Changes → 0.6% of tickets (50 tickets) 

Slack In-app access and actions → 1.32% of tickets (125 tickets)***

Assumptions

* An analysis of the Okta-related app issues indicates that around 60% could be addressed via Okta’s API by the AI worker. Accordingly, 0.6 × 2,648 tickets = 1,588 tickets were considered automatable.

** We assume that 75% of app access tickets can be resolved through Okta, so we calculated: 0.75 * 1680 app access tickets = 1260

** Slack admin API requires Enterprise license

Expected Impact
Data on ticket resolution per employee exists, and ai.work’s discovery agent used it to estimate the potential impact on ROI (headcount). A conservative approach was taken, assuming that tickets suitable for automation are generally the easier ones, typically handled by the employees who resolve the highest number of tickets over time.
During the analyzed period, the AI worker could potentially handle ~3,000 tickets (32% of total tickets). As shown in the employee graph below:
Top performer: 1,000 tickets


Second: 900 tickets (currently handled by existing automation)


Third & fourth performers: 600 tickets each
By automating tickets beyond the current automation, we estimate that the workload handled by the top performers could be reduced, freeing up the equivalent of 3 full-time employees (FTEs).


* This graph excludes workers who solved fewer than 20 tickets during this period.



Phase 2: Long term potential - 3-6 months
Goal of 47% fully automated ticket requests (assuming ai.work has necessary API connections)*
Additional 5% partially assisted by ai.work (does 20-80% of the work and shortens human handle time)**
48% of tickets will remain full human agent handling (specific app actions without API, hardware/network troubleshooting, hardware logistics)

Assumptions

*Full automation assumptions
80% of App access = 14.24%
50% of App issues = 20.87%     
50% of Within-app access = 2.87%
50% of Within-app action = 4.32%
50% of Onboarding / Offboarding = 4.56%
100% of Distribution Lists = 0.6%

**Assistance assumptions
50% of Hardware issues = 1.82%
50% of Hardware Requests = 0.39%
50% of Hardware Replacement = 0.13%
40% of Network, Security and Other = 2.2%
80% of Guidance = 0.41%

Open Questions
Is the access to all apps managed through Okta ? If not, what are the other access management methods?
Are there apps that require direct in-app actions to grant initial access to? Which?
What does the full IT onboarding process look like?
What does the full IT offboarding process look like?
Where is the asset inventory managed?
What is the policy for new hardware requests?
Are there knowledge base articles in place to answer repetitive questions and provide initial support?
What are the approval flows? How are they managed?
